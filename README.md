# javascript-challenge

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to generate a password with 8-128 characters; while including lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers. The main focus was in JavaScript as a code was to be created in order to generate random passwords.

## Instalation

The steps that were required to install my project included assigning a code, getting references to the #generate element, write a password to the #password input, and add event listener to generate the button. Withing each step I included functions that would push the letters and characters to generate on the password.
